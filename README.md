# Tower Defense Test
Created for upjers GmbH

Dependencies:
UniState: FSM Solution
UniHelper: Generic helpful tools, UniState sub-dependency
Both made by me.

I got sick one day after our interview, and did most of the work on Monday - Wedensday. The GitHub activity can testify for me.
I tried breaking the test down just as well as I would break down a real, long-term project.
